"""bounds.py
The idea of upperBoundDiamond is to add first edges whose absence would
force many edges (by the diamond configuration), where 'many' is quantified
by threshold. When no such edge exists anymore, we run mdh.upperBound on the
remaining graph.
Why is upperBoundDiamond better in some cases? Think of it this way. When,
there are diamonds with really high value then the edge we add is likely to
to be in optimum solutions anyway.
