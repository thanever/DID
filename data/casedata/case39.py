def case39():
    """Power flow data for 39 bus New England system.
    Please see L{caseformat} for details on the case file format.

    Data taken from [1] with the following modifications/additions:

        - renumbered gen buses consecutively (as in [2] and [4])
        - added C{Pmin = 0} for all gens
        - added C{Qmin}, C{Qmax} for gens at 31 & 39 (copied from gen at 35)
        - added C{Vg} based on C{V} in bus data (missing for bus 39)
        - added C{Vg, Pg, Pd, Qd} at bus 39 from [2] (same in [4])
        - added C{Pmax} at bus 39: C{Pmax = Pg + 100}
        - added line flow limits and area data from [4]
        - added voltage limits, C{Vmax = 1.06, Vmin = 0.94}
        - added identical quadratic generator costs
        - increased C{Pmax} for gen at bus 34 from 308 to 508
          (assumed typo in [1], makes initial solved case feasible)
        - re-solved power flow

    Notes:
        - Bus 39, its generator and 2 connecting lines were added
          (by authors of [1]) to represent the interconnection with
          the rest of the eastern interconnect, and did not include
          C{Vg, Pg, Qg, Pd, Qd, Pmin, Pmax, Qmin} or C{Qmax}.
        - As the swing bus, bus 31 did not include and Q limits.
        - The voltages, etc in [1] appear to be quite close to the
          power flow solution of the case before adding bus 39 with
          it's generator and connecting branches, though the solution
          is not exact.
        - Explicit voltage setpoints for gen buses are not given, so
          they are taken from the bus data, however this results in two
          binding Q limits at buses 34 & 37, so the corresponding
          voltages have probably deviated from their original setpoints.
        - The generator locations and types are as follows:
            - 1   30      hydro
            - 2   31      nuke01
            - 3   32      nuke02
            - 4   33      fossil02
            - 5   34      fossil01
            - 6   35      nuke03
            - 7   36      fossil04
            - 8   37      nuke04
            - 9   38      nuke05
            - 10  39      interconnection to rest of US/Canada

    This is a solved power flow case, but it includes the following
    violations:
        - C{Pmax} violated at bus 31: C{Pg = 677.87, Pmax = 646}
        - C{Qmin} violated at bus 37: C{Qg = -1.37,  Qmin = 0}
